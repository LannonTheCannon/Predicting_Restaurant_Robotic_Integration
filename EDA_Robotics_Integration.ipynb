    "\n",
    "1. Define the Objectives\n",
    "   1.1 Clearly Articulate the goals of your predictive model.\n",
    "   1.2 Determine the specific cost metrics you want to predict, such as labor costs savings or overall expense reduction\n",
    "2. Data Collection\n",
    "   2.1 Gather relevant data from the restaurant owner, including financial records and operational data pre and post robotic server implementation\n",
    "   2.2 Ensure the data includes features that can potentially impact cost savings, such as labor costs, staffing levels, and other expense categories\n",
    "3. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "   3.1 Clean the collected data, handle missing values, and eliminate any inconsistencies or outliers\n",
    "   3.2 Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis, ensuring uniformity and compatibility between variables.\n",
    "4. Feature Engineering\n",
    "   4.1 Identify and create additional features that may help improve the predictive power of the model\n",
    "   4.2 Consider incorporating time-related features, seasonal indicators, or any other relevant factors specific to the restaurant industry\n",
    "5. Split the Data\n",
    "   5.1 Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Typically an 80-20 or 70-30 split is used, where the larger portion is allocated for training the model.\n",
    "6. Model Selection\n",
    "   6.1 Choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm for regression, as you aim to predict cost savings. Popular opinions include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.\n",
    "7. Model Training:\n",
    "   7.1 Train the selected model using the training dataset\n",
    "   7.2 The model will learn the patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (cost savings) during this phase.\n",
    "8. Model Evaluation:\n",
    "   8.1 Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the testing dataset.\n",
    "   8.2 Utilize evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions.\n",
    "9. Model Refinement:\n",
    "   9.1 Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters or exploring different algorithms to optimize its performance.\n",
    "   9.2 Consider techniques like cross-validation or grid search to find the best combination of parameters\n",
    "10. Interpretation and Insights\n",
    "   10.1 Analyze the trained model to understand the importance and impact of different features on cost savings\n",
    "   10.2 Identify the most influential factors affecting cost savings and gain actionable insights for restaurant owners.\n",
    "11. Prediction and Recommendation\n",
    "   11.1 Apply the trained model to new data to predict cost savings for other restaurant owners.\n",
    "   11.2 Provide recommendations based on the predictions to assist potential adopters in making informed decisions about robot server implementation."
